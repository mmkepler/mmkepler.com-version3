          I have been using every cheap or free resource I can to learn to be a JavaScript developer since 2015.
           I can&apos;t remember what “Learn How To Code” website got me, but they got me.
            I love the idea of a career where you can grow through learning in ways that aren&apos;t just traditional education.

          <p tabIndex="0">I earned Free Code Camp Certifications in Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms &#38; Data Structures, and Back End Development &#38; APIs.
             In 2018 I won a Grow with Google scholarship and earned Udacity&apos;s Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree.
              A lot of my learning has been through project creation. &nbsp;

          <p tabIndex="0"><strong>The dreaded resume gap!</strong> - Just as I was going to make my career jump into programming, my fiance died from injuries caused by a car accident on our way to get married.
             I had to settle his estate while dealing with my PTSD, and I took time off to do this. During this time I started my own business and did some graphic and web work. I also worked on studying as well.
              In early 2020 I decided to move to Denver and go back to work. Then the country shut down, and I started having a lot of health issues. I didn&apos;t think I
            had COVID, but I got a lot of symptoms of &lsquo;Long COVID&lsquo;. My body decided to go haywire. I fought it with all my energy and I am now feeling like I did before this nightmare began.
             I am ready to take on the world again.

          <p tabIndex="0">I love space. That might have something to do with my last name!
             I also love dinosaurs and wanted to be a paleontologist as a child (my favorite is Archaeopteryx!).
              I am a former member of Women Who Code Atlanta and I was a co-host of Woodstock Northwest OTP meetups before I relocated to Denver.
